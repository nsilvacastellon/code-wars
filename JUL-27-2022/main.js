Expressions Matter:
Task
Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
Example
With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

1 * (2 + 3) = 5
1 * 2 * 3 = 6
1 + 2 * 3 = 7
(1 + 2) * 3 = 9
So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

Notes
The numbers are always positive.
The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
You can use the same operation more than once.
It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
Repetition in numbers may occur .
You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

ANOTHER SOLUTION:
function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
  return Math.max(
    a + b + c,
    a * b * c,
    a * (b + c),
    (a + b) * c,
    a + b * c,
    a * b + c,
  );
}
*/
function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
    let mult = a * b * c;
    let sum = a + b + c;
    let parenLast = a * (b + c);
    let sumMult = a + b * c;
    let parenFirst = (a + b) * c;
    let totalArray = [];
    totalArray.push(mult, sum, parenLast, sumMult, parenFirst);
    return Math.max(...totalArray);
  }
